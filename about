A) we have 4 main instances:    - block(a class that creates a square block that, by combining more will create the shapes)
                                - tetromino ( the class that holds the shapes formed with the blocks)
                                -  tetris ( will control the movement of the shapes on the playing board)
                                - app ( the run method that runs the code /  starts the game)


B) to make a tetramino out of blocks:
    - you need a pivot: let the pivot be the origin = the top left corner
    - in the setting file there is a dictionary that contains all the shapes possible: the sjapes are described
by a list of coordinates of all the blocks that makes a shape a shape if that makes sense
    - to display them in the right place we also need to define an offset: so we will use the Vector2 in settings file

C) to make them move on the board:
    - they can only move left, right and down.
    - we define the movement as an incrementation/ decrementation of the x and y axis as necessarily
    - when we have to press a key to move the obj, we will use a timer so that it will move smoothly => the timer is in app class, where we check what tipe of event is. and only if its a user event


D) for collisions on the board
    - we need to check if any block of the thetronimo is inside the board or not. if at least one is not=> we have a collision and it should not show it and be able to move it
    - we need to check the pos of each block so we add the method in Block class and it will be called every time there is a change
    - bc of this change, the shape will not go beyond the board and will rest on the bottom


E) to know what we have on the board:
    - every time a new tetromino lands, we need to update our matrix "field_array"that keeps the positions



F) ROTATIONS : 90 degrees
    - to rotate a poit A 90 degrees around a point P:
                                                       |~~~~~~~~~~~~|
            1. you subtract the coord of P from A :    |  A' = A-P  |
                                  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|   |~~~~~~~~~~~~|
            2. rotate the poit :  | A" = A'.rotate |
                                  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|                       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
            3. you add the coord of the point P back to the rotatation :   |  A = A" + P  |
                                                                           |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
    - to rotate a tetronimo you ritate each block that makes that shape around the pivot and if it doesnt exceeds the bounds
        of the board or doesn't intersect other shapes aka is not a collision => we can rotate it => change its coordinates.
        For that we rotate each block individualy at first
